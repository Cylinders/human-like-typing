# human-like-typing
A Human Like typing simulator using a .exe file. CLI APPLICATION. PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL USAGE. 


This project is a model that uses pyautogui to simulate human-like typing into documents. This application is developed purely with the intent to understand and connect modern day Machine Learning technologies with human-like input simulation to push the boundaries of computing. This application was not at all developed with the intention to circumnavigate applications used to prevent students from cheating. 

REQUIREMENTS: 

PYTHON: pyautogui module (pip install pyautogui)
JAVA: incomplete
C: incomplete



USAGE: 

Step 1: 

Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/Cylinders/human-like-typing 

OR 

Clone the repository using gh repo clone Cylinders/human-like-typing 

OR 

Download from the google drive link: (NOT SET UP YET) 


Use the .py application if you have a ready to use python interpreter. This has the highest chance of working. 

If you have a working JRE, JDK, or JVM, try to use the java application. Middle chance. 

If you are running on a windows machine and CANNOT use the other two, then work off of the .exe file. (if it exists at all). This has the lowest chance of working.
