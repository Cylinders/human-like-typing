# human-like-typing (PROJECT NOT COMPLETE) 
A Human Like typing simulator using a .exe file. CLI APPLICATION. PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL USAGE. 


This project is a model that uses pyautogui to simulate human-like typing into documents. This application is developed purely with the intent to understand and connect modern day Machine Learning technologies with human-like input simulation to push the boundaries of computing. This application was not at all developed with the intention to circumnavigate applications used to prevent students from cheating. 


USAGE: 

Step 1: 

Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/Cylinders/human-like-typing 

OR 

Clone the repository using gh repo clone Cylinders/human-like-typing 

OR 

Download from the google drive link: (NOT SET UP YET) 


Use the .py application if you have a ready to use python interpreter. This has the highest chance of working. 

If you have a working JRE, JDK, or JVM, try to use the java application. Middle chance. 

If you are running on a windows machine and CANNOT use the other two, then work off of the .exe file. (if it exists at all). This has the lowest chance of working.  (NOT SET UP) 


The JAR file should be perfectly fine as of 27 FEB 2024. Use that for any sort of testing. 


The Python application is solely a CLI app, while the Java application has a minimal, albeit functional, GUI.

INTENDED RESULTS: 

Through a deeper understanding of the difference between automated and human keystrokes, hopefully it is possible in the future to flag automated keystrokes on web pages to stop bruteforcers from forcing their way into websites through their superior computing power.
